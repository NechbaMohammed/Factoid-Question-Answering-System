## Introduction
The Factoid Question Answering System is an Open-domain Question Answering (ODQA) project that focuses on answering factoid questions in natural language.

Factoid questions are those seeking brief, factual information that can be easily verified. They typically require a yes or no answer or a brief explanation and often inquire about specific details such as dates, names, places, or events.

Examples of factoid questions include:

- What is the capital of France?
- What is the capital of Morocco?
- When was Wikipedia founded?
- ما هي وحدة قياس التيار الكهربائي؟
- ما هي عاصمة فرنسا؟
- ما هو الجبل الأعلى في العالم؟
- ما هو اللون الذي يرمز إلى السلام في العديد من الثقافات؟
- ما هو اسم العملة الرسمية لمصر؟
- ما هي الصيغة الكيميائية للماء؟

The Factoid Question Answering System utilizes a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to effectively process these factoid questions and generate accurate answers.
